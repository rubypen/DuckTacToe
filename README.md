# ü¶Ü DuckTacToe

**Solo Project | Arduino, Embedded C++, Buttons, LEDs, Shift Registers**

A tangible Tic Tac Toe game built entirely with Arduino and embedded C++. This project combines classic game logic with physical hardware inputs and outputs, including buttons for player moves and multicolor LEDs to display game state. Shift registers efficiently control LED states, creating a responsive, interactive experience on a compact hardware setup.

## üß† What I Built

- Implemented full Tic Tac Toe game logic in Arduino C++, including turn management, win/draw detection, and game reset
- Managed real-time input from physical buttons to select spots on the board with debouncing logic for reliable presses
- Controlled red and blue LEDs (via shift registers) to visually indicate player moves:¬†**Red for X**,¬†**Blue for O**
- Programmed shift registers to handle multiple LEDs efficiently using bitwise operations and byte-level state management
- Integrated a buzzer with musical feedback for game events (e.g., win animations)
- Developed modular functions to maintain clean separation of concerns (game logic, hardware control, input handling)
- Designed wiring and hardware setup to optimize signal integrity and minimize complexity in controlling multiple outputs

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Overview

- **Inputs**: Three buttons used for cycling through available spots and selecting moves
- **Outputs**: 9 RGB LEDs arranged in a 3x3 grid, controlled via two 8-bit shift registers
- **Buzzer**: Plays simple melodies as audio feedback on game events
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno managing game state, input/output, and LED control
- **Wiring**: Efficient use of shift registers reduces GPIO pin usage, while organized wiring supports maintainability and easy debugging
